<ins>To do:</ins>

Adrian:
- Initialisierungstabelle f√ºr Anschlussart!
- Path for 5 measurements per module!
- initialization function (frequency setter when initilized)
- Module setter for request frequency (in sec)

Immi:
- Send and receive function for every module!





Not so important:
- Check after initialization if modules are working and show it in Tab "Modules"

- Clean up functions 
- Clean up leftovers from testing
