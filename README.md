Adrian:
- command line without refresh
- Safe Init to SPIFFS

Immi:
- function to solve and safe SPI package
- pack safed Init
- pack command line

Not so important:
- buttons to download Log files
- XML to show lastCommand and lastInit (or split Js, HTML, CSS and use processor)
- Module setter for request frequency (in sec)
- next to command line choose module configuration (easier command handling)
- PinIn to show workload on website (On/Off time of a high/low Pin)
- Turn On/Off modules in GPIO tab

- Log files for sensordata with timestamp
- Login
- Website working with AsynchronServer

- SPIFFS filesystem (setup with libaries)
- Graphs for sensordata
- Added dokumentation
