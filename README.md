# RFC

__________________________________________________
Further possible improvments:
- Check after initialization if modules are working and show it in Tab "Modules"
- next to command line choose module configuration (easier command handling)
- Turn On/Off modules in "Modules" tab
- Clean up functions 
- Clean up leftovers from testing (console.log etc)
- initialization function (frequency setter when initilized)
- Table for MCU table slots (not working)
